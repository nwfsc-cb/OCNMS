This text file describes the data files for the OCNMS surveys conducted by NOAA's NWFSC between 2015 and 2019. Most of these fields are self-explanatory, but some of the spatial nesting and depth strata have changed over the years and could confuse.

"Pycnopodia helianthoides OCNMS data.csv" contains the raw survey data with fields:
site
transect (each transect is supposed to be 30m long x 2m wide, but there is variation)
observer (which diver did the counting)
transect.area (in m^2, use this field for calculating densities for each transect)
common.name
species(should be all "PYCHEL" for pychnopodia helianthoides)
year
group (should be all "Invert")
Count (number of pychnopodia observed)
area (factor for spatial area within a site. NA for 2015, because we only used 1 area, 1 or 2 in 2016, then N/S or E/W after 2016)
zone (targeted depth in meters for the transect.  2015 were all at 5 m. 2016 and later were 5 and 10 m.)
N.segments (can ignore: how many 10m long segments within the 30m transect were surveyed)
